# About
This is a sample project which demonstrates how to make a simple command-line
chatbot and personal assistant in Python. The project is intented to be
used by begginers as a starting point and then personalized and extended in order
to learn about Python
# Project Based Learning
The best way to learn programming is not to see syntax on a slideshow, but instead
to experiment and play with the features in a project. This template is intended
for beginner to mid lever Python learners to use with project-based learning. By
customizing this chatbot and adding more features, the beginner will learn more
about python by using it.
